# Distance-Calculator
This project involves building a distance calculator using an Arduino microcontroller, an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), 5 LEDs, a buzzer, an LCD display. The system is designed to measure the distance of an object in front of the sensor and indicate the range using visual (LEDs) and audio (buzzer) outputs.
